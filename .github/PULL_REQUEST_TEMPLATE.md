<!--
Thank you for contributing to zammad/zammad-helm. Before you submit this PR we'd like to
make sure you are aware of our technical requirements and best practices:

* https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/

Following best practices right from the start will accelerate the review process and
help get your PR merged quicker.

When updates to your PR are requested, please add new commits and do not squash the
history. This will make it easier to identify new changes. The PR will be squashed
anyways when it is merged. Thanks.

Please make sure you test your changes before you push them. Once pushed, a Github
Action will run across your changes and do some initial checks and linting. These checks
run very quickly. Please check the results. We would like these checks to pass before we
even continue reviewing your changes.
